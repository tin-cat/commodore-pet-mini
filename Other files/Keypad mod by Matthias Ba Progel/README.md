# Keypad by Matthias "Ba" PrÃ¶gel
Matthias is the creator of the builds with serial numbers [0009](https://commodorepetmini.com/user-builds#0009) and 0010 [0010](https://commodorepetmini.com/user-builds#0010), and has also created this Keypad model that fits perfectly the looks of the Commodore Pet Mini.

Here are his comments about this mod:

> You need 15 cherry mx switches (or compatibles), a USB-joystick-controller-PCB (cheap from ebay or amazon for DIY-joysticks) and you're good to go! :)

> You can add some LEDs in every switch if you want.

> Then soldering all switches to GND and 15 cables for the signals (in total 16 wires needed).

> I desoldered all the sockets from the USB-controller pcb, otherwise it won't fit in the case. So there's a little work to do, but with the sockets in place, the joystick came out way too bulky.
